# EbayAmazon

We want to develop an eBusiness platform such that every responsible user can bid/buy and sell items. There are three types of users to this system: superusers (SUs), ordinary users (OUs) and guests (GUs).

# Motivation

This is a computer science courese group project. The goal for this project is that all group members work as a team, and help each other. The primary goal for any team is to grow better and better as each day goes by. But this cannot be achieved unless the whole team stays committed to this goal. A team’s success lies on how well their foundation is built. One of the best ways to enhance the skills and abilities of each member of your team is by conducting a thorough training process from the beginning until the end of your team’s journey.
